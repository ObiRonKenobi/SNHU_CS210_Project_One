# SNHU_CS210_Project_One

This project was to build a clock that imported and manipulated time to create a clock with functions to add minutes or hours.
  
My menu is formatted well and the functions work.
  
I had difficulty importing c_time in a way that makes the clock "tick".
  
I recived a B+ for this project.
  
NEEDS WORK!
